//Step 1: fill in the setup() loop with the size and background
//Step 2: use shapes and fill commands like we did for the bunny to create your own emoji!  
//Step 3: once you have a basic emoji built, add some if-statements whick will allow the emoji to change when a key is pressed
//Step 4: for an added challenge, use variables to make your code more efficient


void setup()       //sets up the screen size and background
 {
 
 //if you set the size to be 400,500 you can use the extra sheets of graph paper to sketch things out
 
 }
 
 
 void draw()       //opens the draw loop
 
 {
 
 //place your drawing code here, between the curly brackets
 //you should have an emoji that you build from ellipses, lines, rectangles, triangles and arcs
 //then add if-statements for keyboard controls to make it change in some way (like grow a unicorn horn, blink its eyes or change its color)
 //use the fill command to change the color of the sphapes that come after it
 //you can use if statements to change color variables, or to only draw certain shapes, like a unicorn horn, if a key is pressed
 //all of this goes in the draw loop
 
 }
