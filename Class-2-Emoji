//here is where you would declare your variables and initialize them
//place them right below this comment and before you start the setup loop
//first I'd start by skipping this part and just drawing the emoji
//then you can include variables and if-statements later


void setup()       //sets up the screen size and background
 {
 
 //if you set the size to be 400,500 you can use the extra sheets of graph paper to sketch things out
 
 }
 
 
 void draw()       //opens the draw loop
 
 {
 
 //place your drawing code here, between the curly brackets
 //you should have an emoji that you build from ellipses, lines, rectangles, triangles and arcs
 //then add if-statements for keyboard controls to make it change in some way (like grow a unicorn horn, blink its eyes or change its color)
 //use the fill command to change the color of the sphapes that come after it
 //you can use if statements to change color variables, or to only draw certain shapes, like a unicorn horn, if a key is pressed
 //all of this goes in the draw loop
